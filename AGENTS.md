# Instructions for agents

Read all Markdown documents in this root folder.

When reading source code, always read each file in its entirety to get the full context; do not rely on grepping because it only gives you a limited view.

The code should use super verbose logging. Trace events use DEBUG level, unusual events use WARNING, errors at ERROR, caught exceptions at CRITICAL, everything else at INFO.
